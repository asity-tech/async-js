    <h1>what is asynchronous js</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        governs how we perform tasks which take some time to complete for e.g
        getting data from database
      </li>
      <li>start something now & finish it later</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>what is synchronous js</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        js by it's nature is sync means js can execute only only statement at
        a time from top to bottom
      </li>

      <li>for eg:
        <ul>
          <li>console.log("line one")</li>
          <li>console.log("line two")</li>
          <li>console.log("line three")</li>
        </ul>
      <li>in the top example line two can't start before line one finish & line three can't start before line one two
      </li>
      <li>means it is excuting one at a time in order</li>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>js is called single threaded language that means</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        there will be thread which is like an ordered sequence of statements &
        only one of those statement can run at a time
        <ul>
          <li>statement 1</li>
          <li>statement 2</li>
          <li>statement 3</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        that's all one statement is being executed at a time after one another
        <ul>
          <li>statement 1</li>
          <li>
            statement 2 -
            <span>
              made a request to database which will take time more than usual,
              now as we know in async programming world only one statement can
              run at a time this fetching of data from database block the
              path/program, as it's blocks the next code from running untill
              the data back
              <ul>
                <li>now you can think what if it will take 2-3 sec more to execute</li>
                <li>stop thinking like that because my dear we'll dealing with lot's of function like these who will be
                  needed more time to excute that could be take more than 10 sec or dependentent on the server
                  performance we don't know exactely</li>
                <li>in that case it will block the rest of the code underneath from running untill those task are
                  complete</li>
                <li>this is the huge disadvange of sync code</li>
                <li>this is why <strong>async code</strong> lands like a boss to help us out</li>
              </ul>
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>statement 3</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>async</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>start now & finish it later</li>
      <ul>
        <li>statement 1</li>
        <li>statement 2 <span>now imagine here we're using a async function to request the external data which maybe
            placed in a server or kahi bhi
            <ul>
              <li>now what will happen browser will take that async function outside of the scope if this single thread
                in some other part of browser & it also put a callback function & puts into one side too so that it
                knows to execute it's later when the data is ready to serve</li>
              <li>now listen carefully, as the browser handle that part of data fetching outside of the scope of the
                thread now js can carry on down & execute the remaining functions</li>
              <li>in the meantime the data fetching part is also going on some other part of the broweser</li>
              <li>when it's receives the data back from the network request & once the rest of the functions have been
                executed then we are allow to call the callback function & finish the original function</li>
              <li>this is what <strong>async js</strong> start now & finish it later, which makes our code non-blocking
              </li>
            </ul>
          </span></li>
        <li>statement 3</li>
        <li>statement 4</li>
        <li>callback</li>
      </ul>
      <li>enough theroy let's dive into practical</li>
    </ul>
